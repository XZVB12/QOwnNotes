# Searching for notes

There are different ways to search for notes:

- `note book` will search for notes with the word `note` or `book` in the file
  name or note text
- `"note book"` will search for notes with exactly the text `note book` in the
  file name or note text
- `n:book` or `name:book` will search for notes with `book` just in the note
  name or file name
