# QOwnNotes Scripting

A QOwnNotes script is mostly **JavaScript** in [Qt QML files](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html).

```js
import QtQml 2.0
import QOwnNotesTypes 1.0

Script {
    /**
        * Will be run when the scripting engine initializes
        */
    function init() {
        script.log("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

You can place those QML files anywhere you like and **add them in QOwnNotes**
by adding them in the **Scripting settings** (there is a button `Add script`/`Add local script`).

::: tip
Take a look at the [example scripts](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/blob/develop/docs/scripting/examples)
to get started fast.
:::

In the **Scripting settings** you can also install scripts directly from the [**Script repository**](https://github.com/qownnotes/scripts).

For issues, questions or feature requests for scripts from the **Script repository** please open
an issue on the [QOwnNotes script repository issue page](https://github.com/qownnotes/scripts/issues).
