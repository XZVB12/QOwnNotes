# QOwnNotes software repository for Debian Linux

<v-subheader class="blog">Date: 2016-01-31</v-subheader>

Beside **Linux** software repositories for **Arch**, **Ubuntu**, **Fedora** and **openSUSE** we now also have a software repository for **Debian Linux**.

The repository also makes use of the wonderful openSUSE build service.

Please visit the [QOwnNotes installation page](https://www.qownnotes.org/installation#Debian) for details on how to use it.
