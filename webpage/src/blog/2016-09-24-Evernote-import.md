# Evernote import

<v-subheader class="blog">Date: 2016-09-24</v-subheader>

You can now **import** your **notes** from **Evernote**.

To do so you have to **select all your notes** and **right click** on them in your Evernote desktop client. Now select ***export notes*** and store them to an *enex* file.  
Then click ***Import / Import notes from Evernote*** in the QOwnNotes main menu and **import** the *enex* **file**.

Formattings like bold and italic will be converted to markdown, as are headlines and links. Images from your Evernote notes will be embedded in your QOwnNotes markdown notes.

You can **download QOwnNotes** on the **[installation page](https://www.qownnotes.org/installation)**.
