# Release and blog posting automation

<BlogDate v-bind:fm="$frontmatter" />

Posting new releases and blog posts to Twitter and the Telegram Group is now done with the help of the free open source software [Beehive](https://github.com/muesli/beehive) instead of the proprietary software as a service IFTTT (which only now only allows three actions for free).

Maybe posting to the Facebook Page can also be handled by Beehive in the future. The "Facebook Hive" needs to be adapted for Facebook pages to allow this.
