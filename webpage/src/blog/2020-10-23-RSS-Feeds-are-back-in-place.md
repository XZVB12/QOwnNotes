# RSS Feeds are back in place

<BlogDate v-bind:fm="$frontmatter" />


Finally the RSS Feeds [QOwnNotes Blog RSS](https://feeds.feedburner.com/QOwnNotesBlog)  and [QOwnNotes Release RSS](https://feeds.feedburner.com/QOwnNotesReleases) are implemented again and can now be used like before.

The Blog RSS Feed is part of the QOwnNotes webpage and the Release RSS Feed is part of [api.qownnotes.org](https://api.qownnotes.org).
