# Script repository and script settings variables

<v-subheader class="blog">Date: 2017-05-19</v-subheader>

In the latest release 17.05.7 of **QOwnNotes** you are now able to **download scripts directly from the new [script repository](https://github.com/qownnotes/scripts)** inside of the application.

Furthermore as a developer you can now **register settings variables** in **scripts**. This allows you to let the user configure your script in the script settings.

A **lot of new** useful **scripts** were **added to the script repository**, which now can be **configured** with the script settings variables.

There are now scripts directly available to

- **encrypt** your **notes** with **PGP** or **Keybase**
- create notes from **Jira** issues or **Bitrix24** tasks
- transform selected note text to **Jira Code** or **BBCode**
- show **statistics** about your **note**
- paste **Latex** code as image
- modify the **styling** of the **user interface** of the application or the **styling** of the **note preview**
- create **journal** or **meeting** notes
- insert a headline and a link to the **GitHub issue** from an url in the clipboard
- **favorite** notes

Feel free to **add your own scripts** to the script repository. You will find a **guide** on how to do so at the **[QOwnNotes script repository](https://github.com/qownnotes/scripts)**.
